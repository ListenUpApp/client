/**
 * Artwork component for the Now Playing screen.
 *
 * Renders the book cover via [ElevatedCoverCard] over a soft ambient glow. The glow is a radial
 * gradient — [primaryContainer] at the centre fading to fully transparent at the edge — so it reads
 * as diffuse light emanating from behind the cover rather than a defined shape. Its bright centre
 * sits behind the cover; only the gentle outer falloff is visible around the cover's edges.
 *
 * The component's layout footprint is the cover [size]; the larger glow is drawn as a centred
 * overlay that overflows those bounds without reserving extra space, so the artwork doesn't waste
 * vertical room on its (mostly transparent) glow margin.
 *
 * @param coverPath Local file path to the cover image, or null.
 * @param bookId Book identifier used for server-URL fallback image loading.
 * @param coverBlurHash Optional BlurHash placeholder string.
 * @param size Side length of the square cover, and the component's layout footprint.
 * @param title Book title, shown in the gradient fallback when no cover can be loaded.
 * @param author Primary author, shown in the gradient fallback when no cover can be loaded.
