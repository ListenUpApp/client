 * Domain model for a book on its detail screen.

 * Carries the full set of fields including [allContributors], [genres], and
 * [tags] — the three fields that always live empty on list-surface read paths.
 * Convert to [BookListItem] via [toListItem] when handing off to a list consumer.
 *
 * Deliberately kept separate from [BookListItem] (see [BookSummaryFields] for the rationale).
 * Computed properties and [formatDuration] are supplied once via [BookSummaryFields].
