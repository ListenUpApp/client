/**
 * Regression tests for the download state reset logic in DownloadManager.resumeIncompleteDownloads().
 *
 * Bug history: resumeIncompleteDownloads() was resetting ALL non-QUEUED states → QUEUED,
 * including DOWNLOADING. This caused the download button to show an indeterminate spinner
 * permanently because:
 *   1. Worker is re-enqueued with ExistingWorkPolicy.KEEP (existing worker keeps running).
 *   2. The running worker only calls updateState(DOWNLOADING) once, at the start of doWork().
 *   3. After the DB reset to QUEUED, no code ever transitions it back to DOWNLOADING.
 *
 * Fix: only reset PAUSED → QUEUED. Leave DOWNLOADING entries untouched.
