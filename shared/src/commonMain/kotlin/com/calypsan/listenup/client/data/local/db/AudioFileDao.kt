/**
 * DAO for [AudioFileEntity] — per-book audio files used by playback and downloads.
 *
 * Queries always return rows ordered by `index` ASC so callers don't have to sort.
 * The backtick-quoted `` `index` `` in raw SQL is defensive — `INDEX` is used as a
 * DDL keyword in SQLite in some contexts, so escaping the column reference avoids
 * any parser ambiguity.
 *
 * Sync / SSE / playback-fallback writers all use the delete-then-upsert pattern
 * inside their existing `transactionRunner.atomically { }` blocks. The DAO does
 * not own transactions itself.
