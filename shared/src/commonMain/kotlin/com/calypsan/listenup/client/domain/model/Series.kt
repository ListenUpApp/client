/**
 * Domain model representing a book series.
 *
 * A series is a collection of related books, typically with a shared narrative
 * or thematic connection. Examples: "The Lord of the Rings", "Harry Potter",
 * "The Stormlight Archive".
 *
 * Books can belong to multiple series (e.g., "Mistborn: The Final Empire" is in
 * both "Mistborn" and "The Cosmere"). This model represents the series itself;
 * the book-series relationship with sequence numbers is managed separately.
