/**
 * Cross-reference entity for the many-to-many relationship between Books and Contributors.
 *
 * A contributor (e.g., Stephen King) can be associated with multiple books,
 * and a book can have multiple contributors (e.g., Author + Narrator).
 *
 * The `creditedAs` field preserves the original attribution name when an alias
 * is merged into a primary contributor. For example, when "Richard Bachman" is
 * merged into "Stephen King", books originally by Bachman keep creditedAs = "Richard Bachman".
 * This allows:
 * - Book detail page to show "by Richard Bachman" (original credit)
 * - Clicking the name navigates to Stephen King (the real contributor)
 * - Stephen King's page shows "The Running Man (as Richard Bachman)"
 *
 * @property bookId Foreign key to the book
 * @property contributorId Foreign key to the contributor
 * @property role The role of the contributor for this specific book (e.g., "author", "narrator")
 * @property creditedAs The name shown on this book (null = use contributor's name)
