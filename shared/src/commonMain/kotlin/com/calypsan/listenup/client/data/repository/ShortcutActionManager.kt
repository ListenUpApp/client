 * 1. User taps shortcut from launcher
 * 2. Android launches MainActivity with action intent
 * 3. MainActivity parses intent and calls setPendingAction()
 * 4. Navigation layer observes pendingAction and executes it
 * 5. After execution, consumeAction() clears the pending state
 *
 * This pattern ensures shortcuts work whether the app is:
 * - Not running (cold start)
 * - Already running (warm start via onNewIntent)
 * - In background (brought to foreground)
 *
 * Thread-safe via StateFlow - can be observed from any coroutine context.
