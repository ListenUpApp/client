/**
 * The canonical [Json] instance for the entire app. All [kotlinx.serialization] encoding and
 * decoding against wire payloads (HTTP, SSE, persisted operation payloads, secure storage)
 * goes through this instance — see Finding 04 D5.
 *
 * Settings:
 * - `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` — forward-compatible with server additions.
 * - `isLenient = true` — tolerates minor wire-format variance (mixed quote styles,
 *   numeric booleans) that streaming payloads occasionally produce.
 * - `prettyPrint = false` — minimize over-the-wire bytes.
 *
 * Consumers that need a [Json] instance should inject `get<Json>()` (via Koin) or
 * reference this value directly. File-local `Json { ... }` blocks are forbidden by the
 * rubric rule derived from Finding 04 D5.
