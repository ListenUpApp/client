/**
 * Single seam for download state and orchestration. All writes to the download DAO route through
 * this repository (Sync Engine Rule 5 compliance). Aggregation lives here so all platforms share
 * the same state-machine reducer.
 *
 * Per W8 Phase B (handoff design § "Expand `DownloadRepository` interface"). Replaces:
 * - The narrow read-only interface that previously lived here (limited to `observeDownloadedBooks`
 *   and `deleteForBook`, used by `StorageViewModel`).
 * - Direct `DownloadDao` access from `DownloadWorker` and `DownloadManager` (those callers will
 *   be migrated to route through this interface in Phase B Tasks 7 and 8).
 *
 * Cross-phase carveout: methods marked **(Phase B alias)** below have placeholder implementations
 * until Phase D adds the corresponding `DownloadState` enum entries (`CANCELLED`,
 * `WAITING_FOR_SERVER`). The alias preserves the interface so Phases C and D don't reshape it.
