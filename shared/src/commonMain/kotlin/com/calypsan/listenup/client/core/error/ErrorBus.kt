/**
 * Global error bus for surfacing errors from any layer to the UI.
 *
 * Any component (repository, sync engine, background task) emits [AppError]s here and
 * the UI subscribes once in `AppShell` to display them via Snackbar.
 *
 * **Migration status:** this is still a singleton `object` for backward compatibility —
 * 73 call sites across 30 files need to be migrated. The rubric target (Finding 01 D9 +
 * resolved checkpoint) is a DI-provided `single<ErrorBus>` injected into consumers
 * instead of a global. That conversion lands as part of W2b alongside the
 * `Result → AppResult` migration (same files touched).
 *
 * Usage (current shape, will evolve to injected `errorBus.emit(...)`):
 * ```kotlin
 * } catch (e: AppException) {
 *     ErrorBus.emit(e.error)
 * }
 * ```
