/**
 * Domain repository owning the staging-location lifecycle for book and series cover art.

 * Supports the preview-before-save workflow: images are written to a temporary staging
 * path so the UI can display them before the user commits the edit. The final commit
 * (or cleanup on cancel/clear) is also coordinated here.
 *
 * Implementations live in the data layer; use cases and ViewModels depend only on this
 * interface.
